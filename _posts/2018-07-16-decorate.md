Of the syntactical goodies of python, one is the [decorator](https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDecorators). A decorator is used to mutate a function or class method. It takes a function and returns a modified version of that function.
Decorators are added with the "@" syntax. An example of this is the `@staticmethod` decorator which changes a class method into a static method.  

```python
class MyClass():
    ....
@staticmethod
def my_static_method(self):
        # Code Here...
```

## Writing your own decorators  

Basically a decorator takes a function as an argument and returns another function. That returned function is used in place of the original function which is decorated.
For example we will write a decorator which will tell us the elapsed execution time of any function.  

## Function as a decorator  

We can use a function to write our own decorator. It takes a function as an input, defines another function inside it and returns that function to be used in place of the decorated function. It would also accept arguments and keyword arguments which are used by the decorated function.  

```python
def time_this(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        out = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print("Elapsed time: ", end - start)
        return out
    return wrapper
```

Then we decorate any function like this.The  function below calculates the [Julia set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set) which we use as an example.  

```python
@time_this
def working_func(z, c):
    f_z = (z ** 2) + c
return f_z
```  

## Using classes as decorators  

A class can be used as a decorator if it implements the `__call__` magic function which must return another function to be used in place of the decorated function.
Additionally a decorator can take arguments for the decorating function. For example in this case we run the decorated function for a number of loops and the number of loops is given as an argument to the decorator.

```python
class time_it():
    def __init__(self, loops):
        self._loops = loops if loops != 0 else 1

    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start = time.time()
            for i in range(self._loops):
                out = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end = time.time()
            print("Elapsed time: ", end - start)
            return out
        return wrapper
```

Then it can be called as  

```python
@time_it(5)
def working_func(z, c):
    f_z = (z ** 2) + c
    return f_z
```

Notice the argument to the decorator.  

## Try it for yourself  

Use the following code to experiment and make something that fits your needs.  
__NOTE__  
This is a very rudimentary form of profiling, better methods are available to find the time spent by a program or a certain part of it.

```python
#! /usr/pin/python3

import time

def time_this(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        start = time.time()
        out = func(*args, **kwargs)
        end = time.time()
        print("Elapsed time: ", end - start)
        return out
    return wrapper

class time_it():
    def __init__(self, loops):
        self._loops = loops if loops != 0 else 1

    def __call__(self, func):
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            start = time.time()
            for i in range(self._loops):
                out = func(*args, **kwargs)
            end = time.time()
            print("Elapsed time: ", end - start)
            return out
        return wrapper

@time_this
def working_func(z, c):
    f_z = (z ** 2) + c
    return f_z

@time_it(5)
def working_class(z, c):
    f_z = (z ** 2) + c
    return f_z

def main():
    working_func(1000, 0.5)
    working_class(1000, 0.5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```
