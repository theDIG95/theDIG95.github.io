Python is a very beautiful language. It contains a lot of syntactical helpers which make life very easy.
One of these helpers if the "context manager"
Simply put, a context manager initializes a resource performs operations on it and when you are done with it it takes care of closing of the resource.
One of the most commonly used ones is the file object context manager. It takes care of opening an closing a file.
Where you would do something like.

```python
file = ("my_file.txt", "w")
file.write("My message")
file.close()
```

It can be done with a context manager as

```python
with open("my_file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("My message")
```

This takes care of opening and closing the file.  

## Creating custom context managers  

We can create our own context managers which initialize and discard a resource the way we would like to. For this we will create a context manager that enters logs into a log file and adds the date and time.  

## Context manager Class  

Essentially a context manager is a class that implements  the `__enter__` and `__exit__` magic functions.
As the name suggests  

- `__enter__` takes care of initialization. It must return an object
- `__exit__` takes care of discarding the resource. It takes three arguments(four if you count the "self" argument) the error type, error number, and traceback, if any errors occur. Or even if no error occur we still need these arguments.  

So we create a context manager class like so  

```python
class log_it_cls():
    def__init__(self):
        self.log_file = None
    def__enter__(self):
        self.log_file = open(LOG_FILE, "a")
        self.log_file.write(
            "LOG STARTED AT: {}\n".format(str(datetime.datetime.today())
        ))
        return self.log_file
    def__exit__(self , e_type, e_val, traceback):
        self.log_file.write("END OF LOG \n")
        self.log_file.close()
```

Then we can use it as

```python
with log_it_cls() as logs:
    logs.write(msg)
```

## Using the contextlib  

With the [contextlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/contextlib.html) we can use a function as a context manager by adding a decorator to it. The function must yield a resource(NOT RETURN).
Again we will implement the class context manager with the context manager decorator.
The contextlib is a part of the python's standard library so we don't need to install anything.

```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def log_it_dec():
    log_file = open(LOG_FILE, "a")
    log_file.write(
            "LOG STARTED AT: {} \n".format(str(datetime.datetime.today())
            ))
    yield log_file
    log_file.write("END OF LOG \n")
    log_file.close()
```

And use it the same, as

```python
with log_it_dec() as logs:
    logs.write("My message")
```

## Try it yourself  

Use this code and try different thing to understand the context managers.

```python
#! /usr/bin/python3

import os
import time
import datetime
from contextlib import contextmanager

BASE_PATH = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
LOG_FILE = BASE_PATH + "/times.log"

class log_it_cls():
    def __init__(self):
        self.log_file = None

    def __enter__(self):
        self.log_file = open(LOG_FILE, "a")
        self.log_file.write(
            "LOG STARTED AT: {} \n".format(str(datetime.datetime.today())
            ))
        return self.log_file

    def __exit__(self , e_type, e_val, traceback):
        self.log_file.write("END OF LOG \n")
        self.log_file.close()

@contextmanager
def log_it_dec():
    log_file = open(LOG_FILE, "a")
    log_file.write(
            "LOG STARTED AT: {} \n".format(str(datetime.datetime.today())
            ))
    yield log_file
    log_file.write("END OF LOG \n")
    log_file.close()

def enter_log_cls(msg):
    with log_it_cls() as logs:
        logs.write(msg)

def enter_log_dec(msg):
    with log_it_dec() as logs:
        logs.write(msg)

def main():
    # With class
    enter_log_cls("Hello World\n")
    enter_log_cls("Hello Again\n")
    # With decorated function
    enter_log_dec("Hello from decorated function\n")
    enter_log_dec("Once more to be sure\n")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

```
