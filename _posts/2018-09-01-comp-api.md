With the increased availability of network connected devices it is beneficial to use APIs (Application Programming Interface) to offload tasks to remote devices so that the work load is distributed to multiple workers and done faster. [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) is a micro-framework that enables us to write APIs in a few lines of code while providing complete functionality. We will use Flask to create a computing API that will allow us to offload calculations onto another machine.

## The Computation  

For this example we will use a simple [Gaussian filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter) over a 3 dimensional array to simulate Gaussian blurring an image. This can be done via the [SciPy Library](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/).

```python
from scipy.ndimage.filters import gaussian_filter
x_arr = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(1024, 768, 3), dtype=np.int32)
filtered = gaussian_filter(arr, 0.5)
```

This computation is to be wrapped in an API so that it may be called from a networked device.

## Creating the API  

We can use flask to create an API that accepts an input file and processes it and returns the result. First we wrap the computational function to receive an array stored in a file and return another file with the resultant array.

```python
from tempfile import TemporaryFile
import numpy as np
from scipy.ndimage.filters import gaussian_filter
def gauss_filter(file):
    # Load array from file
    arr = np.load(file)
    # Filter the array
    filtered = gaussian_filter(arr, 0.5)
    # Create a temporary file for output
    temp_file = TemporaryFile(mode="w+b")
    # Save to output file
    np.save(temp_file, filtered)
    # Return pointer to start of file
    temp_file.seek(0)
    return temp_file
```

We use files here because the Numpy arrays are saved to files. We can use other representations too but this method is preferred in the documentation. We use temporary files that are stored in memory instead of the disk so we do not have an overhead of reading and writing to and from the disk.  
Now we create the API that will receive the input file and return the computed result.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, send_file
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/", methods=["POST"])
def home():
    # Check if request has files
    if request.files:
        # Read the received file
        arr_file = request.files["array"].read()
        # Create a temporary file
        temp_file = TemporaryFile(mode="w+b")
        # Save to temporary file
        temp_file.write(arr_file)
        # Return pointer to start of file
        temp_file.seek(0)
        # Filter the array in the file
        filtered_file = gauss_filter(temp_file)
        # Close the input file
        temp_file.close()
        # Return the computed array in file
        return send_file(filtered_file, mimetype="application/octet-stream")
    # Return error on no attached file received
    return ("No File received", 500, {"Input-Error": "No input file received"})
```

Here we use the base path `"/"` to receive data. The API checks for the presence of an attached file and returns an error in the absence of one. If it does find one it saves it to a temporary file and sends it to the computation function. Then it sends back the computed array file to the sender.

## Creating a client  

Now to send data to be processed we create a client. This client will send a file to the API and receive the returned result.

```python
from tempfile import TemporaryFile
import requests
import numpy as np

def send_file():
    # Random array for input
    x_arr = np.random.randint(0, 255, size=(1024, 768, 3), dtype=np.int32)
    # Temporary file to save data
    temp_file = TemporaryFile(mode="w+b")
    # Write into temporary file
    np.save(temp_file, x_arr)
    # Return pointer to start of file
    temp_file.seek(0)
    # Send request to API
    resp = requests.post(
        "http://127.0.0.1:5000/",
        files={"array": temp_file},
        stream=True
    )
    # Close input temporary file
    temp_file.close()
    # New temporary file for returned data
    temp_response = TemporaryFile(mode="w+b")
    # Read from API and save to file
    for data in resp.iter_content(1024):
        temp_response.write(data)
    # Return pointer to start of file
    temp_response.seek(0)
    # Load array from file
    resp_arr = np.load(temp_response)
    # Close the output temporary file
    temp_file.close()
```

Same as the API, the client also uses temporary files to store data. It initializes a random array and saves it to the temporary file. The temporary file is sent to the API and a response is received. Then the received file is read and converted into an array.
