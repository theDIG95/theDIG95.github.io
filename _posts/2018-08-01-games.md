Through the magic of e-commerce, a huge number of products are available to us. However to keep up with the information of such a large stock of goods can be tedious and extremely time consuming. But like all other digital interactions this too can be automated to save us the hassle of manually doing the task. In this example we will keep track of our favorite [steam games](https://store.steampowered.com/) by periodically checking their prices.

## Loading web pages  

Python has an excellent library called [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) which handles sending different requests such as GET or POST to web servers and getting back the responses. First we store all the links of the games in a text file and then read all those links as a list

```python
def read_links():
    with open("links.txt") as fh:
        links = fh.read()
    links = links.split("\n")
    links = list(filter(lambda x: x.strip() != "", links))
    return links
```

Now for each link we will place a get request to the page and get back the response.

```python
page = requests.get(link, timeout=3)
```

__Note__ Do not place too many requests simultaneously as to not overload the servers of the service providers, or wait between requests.

## Interacting with javascript in the page  

Sometimes the page contains javascript events without which certain portions of the page is not exposed. To do that we use [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/) which is used for browser automation. It has bindings available for python too. Now we will use the selenium webdriver to pass the age check and return the contents of the page.  
But first the web driver has to configured.

```python
from selenium.webdriver import Firefox
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

GEKO_PATH = "geckodriver_linux64/geckodriver"

def config_webdriver():
    ff_options = Options()
    ff_options.set_headless(headless=True)
    ff_driver = Firefox(executable_path=GEKO_PATH, firefox_options=ff_options)
    return ff_driver
```

Here we use the FireFox web driver and use it in a headless mode to reduce resource consumption. Then we pass the age check.

```python
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException

def pass_agecheck(link):
    driver = config_webdriver()
    driver.get(link)
    time.sleep(3)
    try:
        enter_btn = driver.find_element_by_link_text("Enter")
    except NoSuchElementException:
        enter_btn = driver.find_element_by_link_text("View Page")
        enter_btn.click()
    else:
        driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@name='ageDay']/option[text()='21']").click()
        driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@name='ageMonth']/option[text()='August']").click()
        driver.find_element_by_xpath("//select[@id='ageYear']/option[text()='1989']").click()
        enter_btn.click()

    time.sleep(3)
    page_content = driver.page_source
    driver.quit()
    return page_content
```

Here it searches for the different kinds of age checks and provides the appropriate response. Then the content of the page is returned via `page_content = driver.page_source`

## Creating a navigable page with BeautifulSoup  

Now to find the required fields of data from the HTML page we need to make it navigable. To do that we use [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

page_soup = BeautifulSoup(page_content, "lxml")
```

## Parsing Page Data  

Now we use that "soup" of the page to easily find the required data from the page.

```python
def parse_page_info(page_soup):
    purchasable_contents = page_soup.find_all(class_="game_area_purchase_game")
    for i in range(len(purchasable_contents)):
        title = purchasable_contents[i].find("h1")
        desc = purchasable_contents[i].find("p")
        info_link = purchasable_contents[i].find(class_="btnv6_blue_blue_innerfade")
        price = purchasable_contents[i].find(class_="game_purchase_price")
        if not price:
            original_price = purchasable_contents[i].find(class_="discount_original_price")
            price = purchasable_contents[i].find(class_="discount_original_price")
```

We can now do whatever we want with the data now. Store and compare from previous dates or display it in a GUI or an HTML file.
