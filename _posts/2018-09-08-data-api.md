With large amounts of data to store we can run out of space on the local machine very quickly. To solve this problem we can export data to another machine using a simple API designed to store our data. In this example we will use [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) framework to create a API that takes some data and stores it to a database.

## The Problem  

As an example problem we will store out system's temperature to a network machine using an API. We will store the temperature, time and the id of the device it was measured for.  First we create a nwe project.

```bash
$ django-admin startproject <project_name>
```

Then we add a new app to the project.

```bash
$ python3 manage.py startapp <app_name>
```

Finally we register the app in the project's `settings.py`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # DEFAULT APPS ADDED BY DJANGO
    'temp_mon',
]
```

## Creating a Django Model  

To store our data in the database we will first create a model which can take the required parameters adn put them in the database. I our Django app we modify the `models.py` as.

```python
from django.db import models

class SysTemperatures(models.Model):
    zone = models.IntegerField()
    temp = models.IntegerField()
    time = models.DateTimeField()
```

This creates a model that has three fields for the time, temperature and the temperature's zone. Optionally we can add this model to the admin interface so we can view it in the app. We modify the `admin.py` of the app as.

```python
from django.contrib import admin
from .models import SysTemperatures

admin.site.register(SysTemperatures)
```

## Creating a View  

Now that we have a model we add a view so that it can be accessed by remote clients. In the app's `views.py` we add.

```python
from django.http import HttpResponse

from django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDictKeyError

from django.views.decorators.http import require_POST
from .models import SysTemperatures

@require_POST
def add_temp(request):
    try:
        data = request.POST
        zone = data["zone"]
        temp = data["temp"]
        time = data["time"]
    except MultiValueDictKeyError:
        return HttpResponse(status=400, content="Invalid Data")
    else:
        temp_obj = SysTemperatures(zone=zone, temp=temp, time=time)
        temp_obj.save()
        return HttpResponse(status=200, content="Data added successfully!")
```

Here we are first restricting this view to accept only POST requests by adding the `@require_POST` decorator. Then we check the data for validity and return an appropriate response based on success or failure.

## Final settings  

Finally we add a new url to the project's `urls.py` for our view.

```python
urlpatterns = [
    # DJANGO DEFAULT URLs
    path('temp', views.add_temp),
]
```

Before we can actually run this app we need to apply changes to the database i.e migrations as Django calls it. For this we will use the following commands.

```bash
$ python3 manage.py makemigrations
$ python3 manage.py migrate
```

The first command will detect all the necessary migrations to make and with the second command it will apply them.

Now this API can be used with a web server to store data remotely.
