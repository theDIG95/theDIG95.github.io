# Personal Blog

This is the source code for my personal [blog](https://thedig95.github.io/) hosted on [GitHub](https://pages.github.com/) pages.  
This blog is about programming and contains my projects and experiments.  
The theme is a modified version of [Prologue - Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/chrisbobbe/jekyll-theme-prologue)  
A few changes made to the original theme are  

- Darker background colors.
- Modified colors for links, icons to blue.
- Modified header's social links location.
