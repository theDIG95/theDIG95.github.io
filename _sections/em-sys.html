Being an electrical engineer I also believe that 
<strong>Embedded systems</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>FPGA, micro-controllers</em></span>) 
and <strong>IoT</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Raspberry-Pi, Arduino</em></span>) 
are also essential in this connected world and also required to make cost effective devices.
