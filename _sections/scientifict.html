Math is the language of science so a machine must be able to understand math. 
So to make a machine understand math and execute it effectively, I worked with 
<strong>math and scientific libraries</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Numpy, SciPy</em></span>) 
and getting data to the math functions, be it raw/text
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Pandas</em></span>), 
images (<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>OpenCV, Pillow</em></span>),
from the web via <strong>web-scrapping</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>scrapy, requests, beautiful-soup</em></span>) 
or through <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>JSON, XML</em></span>). 
Additionally the data needs to be presented in a human understandable form through 
<strong>graph plotting</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Matplotlib, seaborn</em></span>) 
along with explanations(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Jupyter notebooks</em></span>).
