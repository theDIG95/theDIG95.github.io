An <strong>electrical engineering graduate</strong> 
passionate about understanding machines and more importantly making a machine understand what it should do. 
I believe that programming languages are analogous to human languages in the way that they are used to get a point through to the machines. 
It all depends how good you can express yourself through that language that makes a program efficient and effective. 
I am always looking forward to finding methods, new and old to make the machine understand what it should do in the best possible way.

    <p>“A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. 
        The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. 
        Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t flexible. 
        Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.”</p>
