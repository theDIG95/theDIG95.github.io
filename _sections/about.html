I'm an electrical engineering graduate, passionate about understanding machines and more importantly, making a machine understand what is required of it. 
My major is in computer vision with minor in system design and control systems. 
I believe that programming languages are analogous to human languages in the way that they are used to transfer a message which a machine can understand. 
Always looking forward to finding methods, new and old to make the machine understand what it should do in an effective manner.

    <p>“A computer is like a violin. You can imagine a novice trying first a phonograph and then a violin. 
        The latter, he says, sounds terrible. That is the argument we have heard from our humanists and most of our computer scientists. 
        Computer programs are good, they say, for particular purposes, but they aren’t flexible. 
        Neither is a violin, or a typewriter, until you learn how to use it.”</p>
