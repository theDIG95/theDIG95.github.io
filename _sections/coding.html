<strong>Python</strong> 
is my preferred language. But despite my love for it, it cannot be faster than a compiled, 
static typed language. So I find ways to make it work better than vanilla either by 
<strong>code acceleration</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>ctypes, numba, C/C++ extensions</em></span>) 
or by <strong>multi-core computing</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Multi-Threading/Processing, AsyncIO</em></span>) 
or even different machines in a 
<strong>distributed computing network</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Pyro4, SCOOP, RPyC, micro-services, Apache Spark/Hadoop</em></span>). 
Also more power can be squeezed out of the machine by 
<strong>programming GPUs</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PyCUDA, numba.cuda</em></span>). 
I also believe all code needs to be <strong>unit-tested</strong> 
for its working(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>pytest, unittest</em></span>).
