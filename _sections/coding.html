<strong>Python</strong> 
is my preferred language. But despite my love for it, it cannot be faster than a compiled, 
static typed language. So I find ways to make it work better than vanilla CPython, either by 
<strong>code acceleration</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Cython, numba</em></span>) 
or by <strong>multi-core computing</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Multi-Threading/Processing, AsyncIO</em></span>) 
or even different machines in a 
<strong>distributed computing network</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Micro-Services, Apache Spark/Hadoop, Docker</em></span>). 
Also more power can be squeezed out of the machine by 
<strong>programming GPUs</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PyCUDA, numba.cuda</em></span>) to perform computations. 
I also believe all code needs to be <strong>unit-tested</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>pytest, unittest</em></span>) for its working and protection against regression.
