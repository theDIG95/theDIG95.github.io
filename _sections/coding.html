Python is my preferred language for talking to machines. However, the ease of use comes at a performance cost. 
To overcome this, I employ techniques such as multi-core processing, distributed computing and even orchestrating the GPU to work in conjunction with the CPU. <br />
Also as AI paves the way to the future it becomes essential to talk to a machine in mathematics. 
Apart from mathematics, information plays a vital role in AI and to that end gathering data becomes essential along with presenting the results in plots and graphs for human understanding. 
While writing such a complex code, I also ensure fidelity by testing the code down to individual units. <br />
As human communication is not limited to words, a machine also needs to present intuitive and accessible methods for interactions in the from of graphical interfaces. 
Machines are also a medium of human communication, for that purpose I utilize computer networks to allow for remote interactions. <br />
The advent of cloud computing opens a whole new avenue of opportunities to leverage a large repository of resource for demanding tasks. 
I learned to employ this pool of resources, to compute and store information as required by the task at hand. 
This also enables me to track and maintain larger projects by the assistance of version-control systems, just like this blog. <br />
Being an electrical engineer I also learned to design machines, purpose-build for specific tasks as dictated by the requirements. 
This ranges from a whole array of micro-controllers and FPGAs to IoT devices such as the raspberry pi. <br />
Finally, as a picture is worth a thousand words, I learned to draw representative illustrations and 3D models, in addition to documenting a project to make understanding simpler and efficient.
