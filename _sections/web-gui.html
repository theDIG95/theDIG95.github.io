Even tough I can work with 
<strong>command line</strong>, 
most people prefer a <strong>GUI</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PyQt5</em></span>). 
Additionally in this day and age, an application must be able to communicate with other machines through 
<strong>networking</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>socket-programming, Http server/clients</em></span>) 
and store it's data in a <strong>database</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL</em></span>). 
It also helps if the data can be seen over the internet through a 
<strong>web server</strong>
(<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Django, Flask, Web2Py</em></span>). 
Any modern web-app needs to be responsive
(<strong>JavaScript</strong>) 
as well as beautiful(<strong>HTML, CSS</strong>). 
Since most web servers run on <strong>linux</strong>, 
so do I(run linux that is, not run on) for my development environment.
